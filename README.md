Option Valuation

## Summary
The project titled "Option Valuation: Black Scholes vs Binomial vs Monte Carlo" provides a comprehensive analysis of three widely used methods for option pricing. Beginning with a historical context and a review of relevant literature, the study delves into the mathematical foundations of each method, emphasizing their assumptions and computational intricacies. The project explores option valuation basics such as arbitrage, replication, risk-neutral valuation, intrinsic and time value of options, and moneyness.
The practical application focuses on Tata Steel's near-month call and put options traded on the NSE, comparing the calculated option prices across the three methods using Python. Key insights include the behavior of option pricing under different methods and the volatility smile patterns for call and put options. A hypothetical scenario was introduced where an institution dynamically hedges an ATM call option, showcasing real-world application and strategy evaluation. Additionally, the project analyzed the variation of option Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho) with the underlying price and time, offering valuable inferences for risk management and derivative strategies.
